# Graph Data Science for Supply Chains Part II
## Creating Informative Supply Chain Metrics and Analyzing Performance using Neo4j GDS in Python

This directory contains a notebook for replicate the analysis in the upcoming blog **Graph Data Science for Supply Chains Part II: Creating Informative Supply Chain Metrics and Analyzing Performance using Neo4j GDS in Python** (link TBA).


The notebook relies on an the data from Part1, specifically the Neo4j database created from running `transform-and-load.ipynb`.

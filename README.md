# Graph Data Science for Supply Chain and Logistics
This repository contains example code and demos aligning to the Neo4j [Graph Data Science for Supply Chains blog series](https://neo4j.com/developer-blog/supply-chain-neo4j-gds-bloom/). Each subdirectory corresponds to a part in the blog series:

1. part1 - Getting Started with Neo4j GDS and Bloom 
2. [**Coming Soon!**] part2 - Creating Informative Supply Chain Metrics and Analyzing Performance using Neo4j GDS in Python

The above parts include directions for transforming and loading data into Neo4j.  If you would rather skip those steps and jump right into analysis, the `./data` folder includes a pre-made copy of the Neo4j database (a.k.a. "dump file") that can be easily loaded via [neo4j-admin load](https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/backup-restore/restore-dump/).  The `./data` folder also includes a Bloom Perspective to match the data.
